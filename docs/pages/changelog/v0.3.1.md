# Release notes, v0.3.1

Sparkle is now publishing to [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/withsparkle/service/pkgs/container/service)! ✨

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/withsparkle/service:latest
```

Also, we improved the *logbook calculator*, which is now located at `stream` scope.

```bash
sparkle stream logbook calculate < cat Daily.md
```

Or using `pbcopy/pbpaste`:

```bash
pbpaste | sparkle stream logbook calculate | pbcopy
```
