# Release notes, v0.1.1

Sparkle now has just one binary instead of two! ✨

Before, `sparkle` was related to the server side, and `sparklectl` to the client side.

```bash
sparkle run &
sparklectl whoami
sparklectl stream diary make --until=2023-10-31
```

After

```bash
sparkle server run &
sparkle client whoami
sparkle stream diary make --until=2023-10-31
```

It will simplify the interaction with the service.
