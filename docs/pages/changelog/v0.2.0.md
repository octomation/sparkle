# Release notes, v0.2.0

Sparkle now has a full-text search based on [Typesense](https://typesense.org/)! ✨

```bash
sparkle search [-k api-key] [-s server-address] query
```

At this moment, the call `sparkle search index` is required,
but in the future release, it will be a part of `sparkle server run`.
